<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Im ricing my linux setup, and i want firefox to follow my current Catppuccin theme. The problem is that i also have a switcher between light and dark mode, or sometimes i want to change the highlight color. The [firefox colors](https://github.com/catppuccin/firefox) version doesnt allow this, so i wrote this extension. You could install it from the [Firefox addons page](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/catppuccin-selector/)
